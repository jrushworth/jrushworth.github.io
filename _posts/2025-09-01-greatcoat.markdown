I'm sure I probably did but I don't ever remember driving to work in a car.

![Awahuri](/assets/images/cb350.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}I had my CB350 to ride to Roger Clausens when working on the dairy farm at 450 Number 1 Line Longburn. I was working for Roger but I'm pretty sure that the farm was owned by Williams Bros.

I always had a shortage of riding gear and, for a while, my goto was an old army greatcoat.

After I got sort of let go from the farm I got a job at Premier Foods in Feilding, owned by Doug Haig and maybe Jim Bull?

It was shiftwork and could be long hours but the money was amazing! $105 a week in my hand was more that anyone else I knew. It was almost too much to spend.

I'd sometimes go into Feilding on my way home. Maybe this was after a night shift? Or maybe it was a shift that finished at 4pm? 

![Awahuri](/assets/images/autumn-testament.jpg){:width="150px"}{:style="float:right"}I'd go to Carthews bookstore and browse along the mezzanine floor among the piles of books.  Among others I distinctly remember buying James K Baxters 'Autumn Testament' (1973), Sam Hunts 'Time To Ride' (1975), and Mark Satin's 'New Age Politics' (1976).

![Awahuri](/assets/images/time-to-ride.jpg){:width="150px"}{:style="float:left;padding-right:5px"}I used to stop at the Awahuri dairy on the way home. I'd get a peanut slab which I'd make last as long as possible. Little nibble, suck all the chocolate into oblivion, and then savour each peanut. I'm pretty sure that they weren't wrapped in cellophane like they are now. Just stacked in their Whittakers box. It'd get served in a small white paper bag.

My overcoat was rough and my big boots make each stride into a statement. I remember being slightly offended when a young mother quickly pulled her daughter out of the way as I strode into the dairy. Obvioulsy I was dangerous and not to be trusted. 

Little did she know that you only meet the nicest people on a honda.
