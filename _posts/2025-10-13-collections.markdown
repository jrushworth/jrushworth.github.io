I've always collected precious things. I kept an easter egg for at least a year in my little desk when living in Feilding. I finally unwrapped it to find that it was perished.

I had my collection of "Look and Learn" magazine that I used to get from the bookseller on North Street, just over the road.

Then there was "Omni" magazine and others. "Rolling Stone", "Kiwi Rider", etc.

All the Louis L'Amour westerns (after Jean or sombody bought me "Mojave Crossing" for a birthday or xmas present.)

![Awahuri](/assets/images/books/the-loner.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}And all the "Edge" series, marketed as "The Most Violent Westerns in Print." Which, funnily enough, Jack read. He might have been recovering from something, not sure. I was so surprised. Really felt that they weren't his thing.

Then there was the window sill of drink cans in the 'sun porch' room. Was that before it was enlarged? I sort of remember those cans being stacked against the louver windows.

I sort of seemed to collect motorbikes for a while. And motorbike magazines.

And I have a huge collection of paper from events that I've been to. Going back 30 years!

And all those old listeners. And the plastic models that have never been made up.

T-shirts... so hard to throw out old clothes. Partly because of what they mean, partly because I'm scared of running out.
