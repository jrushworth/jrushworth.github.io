When we arrived the house had already been basterdised. 

The interior passage had been reshaped to make the original kitchen a bit bigger.

__Bed 1__ had been extended out onto the porch, and the porch had been further closed in to create __Bed 3__ and __Bed 4__.

We arrived sometime around Easter 1971. I remember Rosemary Eagles being here and discussing changes with Jack. I'm not sure if she drew any plans or not. 

I wish I could remember the time-lines but I can't. Did the glasshouse come first? Or the house? It must have been sometime in the 70's that Jack, with some help from John Jenkins down the road, made some major alterations.

The horrible louvers in __Bed 3__ were removed and the room was enlarged. The __lounge__ was extended, and the old fireplace removed. The fireplace had a date of 1896 or something in it. A small porch was built in the corner of __Bed 3__ and the new lounge.

 __Bed 5__ was added, with access off the old back porch.

Maybe 10 or 15 years later Jim Robertson helped Jack incorporate an old lean-to shed on the back of the house into the washhouse.

Jane and I arrived sometime in 2002. Who was the neighbour of Lyn Jolly who helped with the plans? 

Barry Rasmussen (a retired builder from Feilding) helped with some of the changes, including building all the shelves in the 'Glory Hole.'

The outside wall with horrible louvers in __Bed 1__ were draughty and broken. Merv Heard from Rotorua helped build a new wall on the old wall line and put in some new french doors. The old louvers stayed and the porch deck was never reconstructed.
 
We closed off the porch access to __Bed 5__ and knocked a hole in from the __lounge__. __Bed 5__ became the new kitchen. 

When we took down the old wallpaper in __Bed 5__ we discovered the gib stopping that Andrew and I had done as young boys. What a dogs breakfast! I hired a concrete grinder and polished the floor. The concrete had been pretty rough.

We removed the very tired pot belly stove from the old __kitchen__, along with the hot water cupboard. The old __kitchen__ was now a study, with an attached 'Glory Hole'. 

The house was repiled, rewired by Geoff Remnant from Feilding Sqaush, and reroofed by Lance Berry. A new hot water cylinder was installed in the roof.

We put a solar panel on the roof to heat the hot water and a large Metro fireplace in the lounge. The fireplace had a wetback going to the new hot water cylinder. 

Later on, when we built the big new green shed, Barry and I fixed up the floor and roof line of the old __WC / back porch / wash house__. Until then it had been very sub standard, even leaky. Now it was just horribly unfinished.

At some point Barry Rasmussen helped put in some wooden french doors in the __new kitchen__. The old aluminum ones were pretty worn and, one day, little Hannah gave them a bit of a push and they fell out and smashed!
