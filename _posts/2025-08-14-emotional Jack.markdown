Jack was so strong, so stable. He expressed excitement for the benefit of others and did seem to love life but I rarely saw or heard his softer side.

He told many stories of his parents, especially his father but his passion was implied.

There were only a few times when I saw or heard of a flicker.

Battle Of Britain

Haka in ?

Death of ? in his mini in Whangarei.
