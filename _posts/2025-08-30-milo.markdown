Jean did most of the cooking but it wasn't like Jack was a stranger to the kitchen. And he was always there to carve the roast. His knives were sharp and he knew what he was doing.

![Milk Bottles](/assets/images/old-milk-bottles.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"} On cold winter mornings he'd make us a hot milo in a 600 ml milk bottle. Jean kept growling at him when she saw it. I think she had two reasons. One was that the hot water might cause the bottle to break, and the other was that we were drinking too much milk and milo and she thought it wasn't good for us. She was probably right on both counts but that's not what love is made of.

Jack always made himself the most atrocious snacks. They nearly all had vegemite and then anything he could find. Doesn't sound so bad now but cottage cheese, avocado, last nights dinner, and vegemite, all mushed together and smeared on a piece of brown bread never appealed to me. I suspect that he was a little hurt that he couldn't share his culinary concoctions with us.
