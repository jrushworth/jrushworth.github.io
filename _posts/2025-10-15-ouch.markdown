Been a lot of injuries.

# JOHN

Broken leg, remember being so terrified when they were cutting plaster off with electric saw. Then feeling so light and powerful and leaping over the brick wall out the front of the old A & E.

Jumping over pushbike at Mangaweka and embedding pedal in my right(?) knee.

Push-cart down hill at [Highland Christian Camp](https://www.highlandhome.co.nz/) at Pohangina, angle iron through my left (?) knee.

Big toe on left foot when wheelstanding bike across intersection at Awahuri, trying to impress Kathryn Haigh... footpeg landed on toe.

Left ankle when fell off CX coming back from Cold Kiwi to Stratford, via Forgotten Highway.

Phil Galbraith breaking my patella at The Office bar (next to Cobb & Co in Main Street)
