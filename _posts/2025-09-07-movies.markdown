I've always loved movies. And I'm horribly sentimental about them. They sort of get divided into groups in my mind.

There are certain movies I associate with my father. I was raised on stories of him on horseback, rounding up cattle in the bush. In my mind he was tough; stoic; capable.

I have no idea whether any of these movies represented a real part of his personality, or if he liked them. I only know how I feel.

![Awahuri](/assets/images/movies/lonely-are-the-brave.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}Lonely are the Brave (1962) is something I remember watching wih Jack and Jean on TV. My guess is that it was in the 70's sometime. I suspect that it was at Awahuri but I must have still been quite young. I'm sure that it was because of this movie that I named one of my dogs "Whiskey."  Without really remembering the reason for my conviction I am sure that Jack enjoyed this story.

![Awahuri](/assets/images/movies/the-great-escape.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:left"}I would have said that I saw The Great Escape (1963) at the movies with Jack and Jean but maybe it was something we saw on TV. Jack used to talk about his father being a POW in the first world war. Maybe this movie resonated slightly because of that. Charles Bronson played Flight Lt. Danny Velinski 'The Tunnel King', and somehow I associated him with both my father and with Tom Hawira from Mangaweka/Raetihi. Is Turama Hawira the boy who came and stayed with us?

![Awahuri](/assets/images/movies/junior-bonner.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}The last movie I ever watched with my father was Junior Bonner (1972). I took the DVD over to Marton to watch it with him. The family themes and laconic echoes of changing times eats at me. I suspect that we'd seen it before but I can't really remember. Jack said he enjoyed it but he would say that.

![Awahuri](/assets/images/movies/cool-hand-luke.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:left"}Cool Hand Luke (1967) doesn't really belong in this list because I don't direcly associate it with my father. I remember asking Sarah's doctor what we should call Captain and he suggested "Luke", after Cool hand Luke. Luke doing ["Plastic Jesus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9tuuznL1Y) and Harry Dean Stanton signing ["Just a Closer Walk with Thee"](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x42vd22) open every sentimental pore in my body. I enjoy looking at this movie and seeing so many familiar faces. George Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Jo Van Fleet, J D Canon, Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Joe Don Baker.  Maybe I feel that Arletta's unconditional love for her wayward son echoes my own parents affection for me.
