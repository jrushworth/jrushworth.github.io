As a small child in Feilding I remember the worn old chopping block out by the shed. We used to buy coal from the coal merchant in Weld street (next to Ingram & Worsley, now the Harley shop) for the coal range.

One of my first injuries was either xmas or a birthday when Jack gave me a small hatchet and some rope. The hatchet had been lovingly sharpened and, as I ran around the house pretending to be an indian I slipped and my holstered tomahawk sliced into the front of my left thigh.

After we moved to Awahuri we'd go out to Tangimoana to get wood. Quite often from one of the islands on Athol Bentley's farm. Or to a scrubby pine forest on the left, just before Tangimoana. Maybe controlled by Maureen Hill and her husband?

Working at Premier Foods, Phillip Bird came out to help a couple of times with his hot little Datsun SSS. One time, coming back with a trailer load, we got into a massive fishtail coming down the Taipo Road hill. The car was being thrown from one side of the road to the other and Phillip had close to zero control. It was obvious that we were going to go headfirst into the bridge at the bottom of the hill. Totally by chance the car and trailer zigged at exactly the right moment to allow us to thread the bridge at full speed. Can still feel the thumping in my chest. 

I remember Jack helping others get wood. Was so proud when he was out there with his axe, steadily splitting away. Mac Eruera was also working away, as were several other men. But they'd stop for smoke breaks or a bit of a breather. Jack just kept splitting. Must have been his mid to late 60's?

Jack was in hospital at one stage and I hoped up in the old macrocarpa hedge with a slasher and worked my way from one end to the other, pruning the branches away from the power lines. Jack said I was a bit of a bushman.

I was pretty lazy. My over-worked parents were always happy to have a bit of help. For a while my job was to fill the woodbox. You filled it from the outside, and there was a little door just beside the fire inside where you'd get the next piece to burn. I'm sure that a full box would last a week so it wasn't a particularly odourous task. In fact I enjoyed it. When I did it. As with everything, the trick was to actually walk outside and get the wheelbarrow. Often the woodbox would be empty and Jack would disappear into the winter night to get more wood.

For a while I was splitting everything with an axe, with some wedges and a mallet for the particularly tough bits. I can never chop wood without feeling a connection to my father. At some stage Jane broke the handle of my current mallet. Maybe ran it over with the van or tractor? And that was the end of that. I still chop a bit with the axe but the wood-splitter is so much easier.
