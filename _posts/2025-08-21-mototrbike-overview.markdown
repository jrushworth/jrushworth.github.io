I remember being fascinated a motorcycle that occassionally turnd up at the house in Feilding. I reckon I must have been only 5 or 6. Triumph maybe? Had a carrier on the tank. Used to think that riders sat on the tank.

Then Harold Osborne's farm at Dannevirke. Bouncy step-through honda farmbikes that seemed so exciting. And Jim Webb, next door, with his XL100 farmbike.

Convinced Jack to get me one, remember going into Tim Gibbes, speaking to John Jameison, getting a box of parts from the workshop. A big orange AG175.

Must have been about now that I did Stan Key's course at the back of Central Normal school grounds, off Beresford Street. On little 50cc motorbikes. It was from there that I got my licence, never once taking off my glove and letting the officer who followed me know that I had no fingers on my left hand. Maybe Stan mentioned it? 

Next up might have been a Kawasaki 100 farm bike with dual ratio gearbox.

Finally the mighty [Honda CB350]({% post_url 2025-09-01-greatcoat %}). Jack and I went to pick it up from a female Massey student at the top of the hill somewhere, maybe even in a hostel, probably a flat.

Next was the 1977-78 RD400E, brand new, again from Tim Gibbes.![RD400E](/assets/images/Yamaha RD400_78_1.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}

![XS400F](/assets/images/XS400F.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:left;padding-right:5px"}After that had been crashed a bit and put through the wringer and I'd gotten sick of it always being just out of tune, traded it in on a new XS400F (79-82 model???). Really wanted an XS650 and thought that I was doing the right thing. My brothers CB400 was so much better.

![CX500](/assets/images/cx500.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}Co-op Honda provided the brand new bright red CX500. Would have bought a 2nd hand GS1000S from ANZA when they used to be on the corner, but the salesman wouldn't let me test ride it. Same with the R90S in the Wellington shop (Ghuznee or Dixon street?). I test rode Bob Pink's blue CX and loved it. My new bike took me everywhere. My brothers CB750 was faster and much sportier but I liked my ugly duckling.

![Denise's CD200, My CX, Andrew's CB400N](/assets/images/three-hondas.jpg){:width="250px"}{:style="float:left"}Finally the BMW R100RS from Duncan McKee in Wellington, Boxer Performance. Imported damaged from America. 

Don't forget the T500's, RD125, ?

In between there was an XR200, then an XR250, followed by Bryan Davidson's XR600.

![Denise's CD200, My CX, Andrew's CB400N](/assets/images/all-bikes.JPG){:width="250px"}{:style="float:right"}On the side there was 
 - (Hazel & Captain) a PeeWee 50, two DS80's an XR100, an RM80, and a KDX200.
 - (Hannah) GasGas80, GasGas 125, 
 - (Jane) Beta Tecno 250, Honda RS250, MT07
